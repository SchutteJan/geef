Geef is a minimal Go web application that redirects users to a payment link based on the URL path (e.g. /10 for a â‚¬10 payment). It uses a pluggable provider system to support multiple payment services like banks or third-party platforms. New providers can be added by implementing a simple interface that maps an amount to a payment URL.

The plan is to construct this app as follows:

1. Create an interface for payment request method for providers like Tikkie or Bunq.

This interface must include at least: amount (as integer) and description (optional)

Which provider to use and which currency is provided as a runtime argument to the webserver

2. Create a webserver that extracts the interface parameters from the url

Examples:

domain.com/10 -> {amount: 1000, description: null} 
domain.com/9.20 -> {amount: 920, description: null} 
domain.com/9,20 -> {amount: 920, description: null}
domain.com/10/pizza -> {amount: 1000, description: pizza}
domain.com/ -> doesn't have to work
